      <p>
        In a blender, blend the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and mix with a spoon. Pour the batter into cupcake liners placed inside a large baking tray, ensuring they are side by side. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until baked and golden. Remove and let cool. <br><br>

        For the filling, combine all the ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened. Turn off the heat, let cool, and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream into another piping bag with a star tip and set aside. <br><br>

        To assemble, make a hole in the center of each cupcake and fill with the reserved coffee-flavored brigadeiro. Decorate the tops of the cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream in circular patterns. Garnish with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
